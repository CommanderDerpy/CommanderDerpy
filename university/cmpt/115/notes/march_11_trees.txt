Application of Binary trees.
- Compression of text
- Huffman coding - creating a tree
Step 1 - Create a list of trees, one fro each character
Step 2 - Find the two trees with the smallest freq.
    - Join those two trees ( adding their freq values), and put the result back in the list
    - Repeat that and with the smallest 2 freq and build slightly larger trees
    - When ties, make arbitrary choice
    - When only one tree left you are done.
