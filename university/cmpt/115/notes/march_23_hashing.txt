( Seed )

what is wrong with this idea
    use student numbers as index of array

- memory inefficient
- if we don't have enough indexes 
But very fast search

Hash function - transforms a key to a unique key for an index of an array
Hash-key for an index of an array

Hash function is the identity function

Folding
- key is divided into parts
123-456-789
added these 3
1368 
and div by 1000
368
Note:  1 million SIN also get mapped at index using this folding method.

There are lots of different ways to hash keys.

Collision is almost garmented.
We have to find some way to resolve this
we can not just toss something out.

skipping collisions have to be constant same with the hashing function and with one another ( otherwise we won't be able to find any collision ( doubles m ))
