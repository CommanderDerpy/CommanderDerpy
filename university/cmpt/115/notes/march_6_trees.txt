Breadth First traversal
- From top to bottom
- 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8
top then one down
left then right
one down to the left
etc...
or Root down (siblings before children)
- we can not do this without using Queue

maybe in the assignment - page 76
Order of operations

Binary search tree (is different) always in order
