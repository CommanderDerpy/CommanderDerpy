Tree ATD

- Arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues - are all linear structures
- Trees allow data to be organized hierarchically
- A tree contains nodes which are connected by arcs
- Each node has one parent, and zero or more children
- A node is connected to its children by arcs
- One node, the root node, has no parent.
 

O = ROOT = Has no parent
O = LEAF = Has no child
O = data
--- = Arc or parent
Levels = level at which data is represented at

O ---- O

O = Parent
|
|
O = Child

O --- O Siblings

if the root contains NULL the tree is empty

Level of the tree is each element
Level is the length of the path
O 0
O 1
O 2
etc

height is measured in branches or arcs
O height = 0
| height + 1
O height = 1
| height + 1
O height = 2
