Cerebral Lateralization
    - Left side of the Brain controls the Right side of the body
    - etc
    - Smell is the only function that does not follow this rule
    - Vision is weird - both apply.
        + See slides for more info.
        + Picture.
        + if the connection to the right or left side is completely cut ... 
Split Brain Experiment
    - People were shown photos ( see slides )
    - They said the saw one person on the right and pointed at the other with the left finger
        + Because the two hemispheres are separated ( language is on the left )
        + Face and vegetables 
            * Right side can see faces so When he sees a veg-face on the left he sees a face
            * and when seen on the left he sees vegetables.

Hemispheric Allies or Opposites 
    - Most people do language in left side of the brain
    - researches belief : Left side must be dominant?
    - Right side is for facial recognition music processes and spatial-visual ability.

Where is the Self?
    - We walk by ourself.
    - Brain structure creates sense of reality, interacting mental modules.
    - Frontal lobe may be critical for Self

His and her brain
    - Are there differences?
    - Some evidence suggest anatomical differences. 
    - Differences in lateralization of language
        + Males show left hemisphere activation only whereas women show both
        + See picture on next slides

Problem with gendered Brains
    - See slides
    - problem with conclusions
        + They are all Stereotypes
        + Brain differences do not necessary explain behavior or performance.
        + Sex differences in the brain could be the rildt rather than the causes of behavioral differences.

#END OF CHAPTER 4

Body Rhythms and mental States
    - Biological rhythms 
    - Dreams
    - drugs'n stuff

Understanding Biological Rhythms.
    - Biological Rhythm
        + A periodic more or less regular fluctuation in a biological system
    - Circadian Rhythms
        + ever 24 hours
        + The Sleep and wake cycle
    - infradiam Rhythms
        + Menstrual cycle
        + bird migration
    - ONE MORE slides

Circadian Rhythms.
    - Occur in plants, animals, insect and people.
    - To study - isolate volunteers - cave
    - What has been found?
        + Body can adjust to them and take the over\
        + Jarrods 28 hours cycle lol.
    - Can be effected by illness and such
        +  everyday stuff

When Internal Clocks are Out of Sync
    Internal Sync
        + Jet-lag
        + Adjusting to the new clock
        + Trying to catch up
    - Shift work
        + Efficient Drop
        + PErson becoming more tired
        + Accident more likely
        + Sleep disturbance
    - Coren (1996)
        + Found that the spring shift to daylight savings time produced a short term increase in the likelihood of the accidental death
Mood and Long-term Rhythms
    - Seasonal Affection Disorder (SAD)
        + depression during the winter
        + Treatment involve photo therapy 
        + 2 - 20 % effectiveness with the therapy.
Moods and Menstrual Cycle 
    - PMS
    - Vague Cluster of physical and emotional syndromes associated with the days of preceding menstrucal that was labeled as an illness
    - Physical Syndrome (eg. cramps wter retention, )       
    - MORE STUFF SLIDES!
    - 13 % of all women 
    - physical symptoms are common and emotion are rare ?
        + Cramps etc
        + other stuff SLIDES
    - See slides
Research conclusion about "PMS"
    - No gender differences exist in mood
    - No relation between menstrual cycle and emotional symptoms.
    - No consistence PMS

Why We Sleep
    - We don't know why we sleep
    - Might be to restore some functions, gives the body time for :
        + repair cells 
        + strengthen the immune system 
        + recover abilities lost during the day
    - We make up for RM sleep the next night ( double RM function )
    - if we don't sleep out body eventually shut down.
    - See slides Read the book about it   
    - Sleep apnea
        + stops breathing during the sleep
    - Nacroclepsy
        + Disorder involving sudden and unpredictable daytime attacks of sleepiness or lapses into REM sleep 
    - REM behavior disorder.
        + Muscle paralysis associated with REM sleep does not occur, and sleeper (most males) may "act out" Their dreams.
    - Sleepwalking 
        + Slow-wave sleep
    - enuresis (bed-wetting) stage 4 sleep
    - night terrors  stage 4
        + most common in children
        + little evidence of psychological causes
    -  Day time sleepiness
        +  not enough sleep
    - Need more than 6 hours of sleep (optimal 8 hours
Benefits of Sleep
    - Memory consolidation
        + Process why which the synapes associated with recently stored memories become durable and stable casuing memeroy to become more reloable.+
    - Linked to REM sleep and slow wave sleep
    - may also enhance problem solving abilities.
