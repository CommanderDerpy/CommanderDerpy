#Genes, Evolution and Environments

There are some differences
    2 to be exact

    - Nativists : emphasized genes and inborn characteristics (nature)
    - Empiricists : Focus on learning and experiences (nurture)

- Genes give the basic guidelines for our DNA and are located within our chromosome (23 pairs)
- Within Genes there are 4 chemical elements
    + Adenine (A)
    + Cytosine (C)
    + Thymine (T)
    + Guanine (G)
- Genome is a full set of genes in each cell
- Linking studies
    + Looks at patterns of  inheritance of genetic markers in large families in which a particular trait is common
        * Genetic Markers - Segment of DNA that varies among individuals, was known location on a chromosome, and can function as a genetic 
        marker for a gene
- We can not link genes on a chromosome to a specific trait of behavior - pairs of genes pairs are responsible for that
- *Evolution* is a change in gene frequencies within a population over many generations
    + mutation
- Natural selection (Darwin)  ( I know all of this so I am not going to write too much about it )
    + Sexual selection played a role within Natural Selection 
        * Inter-sexual - one member chooses its partner
        * Intra-sexual - competition over a mate

##Traits and Preferences
- Evolutionary Biologist
    + Start with observing characteristics and do and describe things in evolutionary terms
- Evolutionary Psychologist
    + focuses on the psychophysical changes of the generations and what behavioral tendencies may have been selected to overcome these challenges

- Mental Modules - A perspective is that the mind reflects mental modules shaped though evolution
    + Mental Modules - brain is sectioned into different parts of the brain to account for certain traits (location of food, find a mate, etc)

- Innate Human Characteristics - Evolution has shaped this 
    + Infant reflexes
    + An Interest in novelty (**the quality of being new, original, or unusual.**)
    + A desire to explore and manipulate objects
    + in impulse to play and fool around
    + Basic cognitive skills (**the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought, experience, and the senses.**)
- Language is a Human Heritage (combines meaningless elements such as sounds and gestures giving it structure and meaning)
- We have a Innate capacity for Language (we learn language very early on AND show signs of this trait shortly after birth [shortly is relative ((7 months )) ] ) 
- Other argue that the environments plays a large role in the development of language
    + Like computers can learn some aspect of language (slides don't talk about the philosophical and technical limits [does not really learn])

## Our Human Heritage: Courtship and Mating

- Sociobiology
    + Interdisciplinary field that emphasizes evolutionary explanation of social behavior in animals and humans
    + We usually act upon maximizing the chance to pass our genes as well as helping close biological relatives do the same
    + Slide 19 which is weird .. will not cover it (should not be on test)
    + Cross-cultural studies have shown consistent differences between male and female
        * Mating pref, age predict status and dominance in men and fertility in female
- Criticisms of evolutionary explanation of sex differences
    + Stereotype vs actual behavior
    + Convince vs representative sample
    + What people say vs what they do
    + Fred Flintstones problem (maybe look up or search book for this)
- The Genetics of Differences 
    + a statistical estimate of the proportion of the total variances in some traits that is attributable to genetic differences among individuals within a group
    + Expressed as proportion .60 or 60/100 within a max value of 1.0
    + High Heritability means greater genetic contribution to trait

- Facts about Heritability
- only applies to a certain group of people in a certain area
- no individuals only groups
- even high irritability can be modified by the environment

- IQ (intelligence quotient)
- derived from norms of standardized IQ test
- Children and adolescents (0.40 -0.50), Adult (0.60 - .080)

- Group Differences (Tomato plant example( cloned ) . Same seed but different environment)
    + Environment can effect the way you grow up
    + turning on and or off genes when needed
- evince in humans with such effect
- Reduced
    + Poor prenatal care
    + Malnutrition
    + Exposure to Toxins
    + Stressful family circumstances
- Improved or enhanced
    + Good Health and nutrition
    + Mental enrichment in home, child care and school
    + Parental interaction, discussions and encouragement of mental processing
- Genes and environment interact 
- IQ average has been rising over the past decades. (developED countries)
- Effect seen in developing countries as well

##Beyond Nature vs Nurture
- Gene and environment interaction is very complex
- New tech has raised new questions
    + What is a gene
        * Can be fragmented or intertwined with other genes
    + DNA can be found outside of genes (junk DNA)
        * Maybe part of mutations
    + G and E interaction makes the unique mixture of quality that make a human
    + Epigenetics
        * A new area studing changes in genes expression due to mechanism other than structural changes in the DNA
