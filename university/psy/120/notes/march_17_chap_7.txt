Operant Conditioning.
- Skinner though that this can explain most of human behavior.

Token Economies
 - token function as reinforcer for desired behaviors that can be exchanged for rewards.

Bargaining with children to do chores/homework
- Linked respond deprivation theory - behavior become preferred...

Reinforcement schedules

Fixed Ratio
- Reinforcement after fixed amount of  responses emitted.
Variable Ratio
- The average number of responses between reinforcement is predetermined
Fixed - interval
- Reinforcement  is delivered for the first response after a fixed period of time
Variable - interval
- The average interval between reinforcer is predetermined


Shaping
- Reinforcing any response that successively approximate and ultimately match the desired response
- Use differential reinforcement to define steps along the way

Learning and Biology

Biological Constrains on learning 
- Limitations on learning that are imposed by a specific genetic endowment
Instinctive drift
- When learned behavior drifts back towards specific instincts.
    Raccoon example
    1 coin vs 2 coins
Taste-aversion learning
- Single pairing of a CS (novel flavor) with consequences ( UCS of illness)
Bad taste to food ( sheep and coyotes.) 

Making particular connection and but others.
- Rat experiment.

Behavior modifications
- The applications of operant conditioning techniques to teach new responses or to reduce or eliminate maladaptive or problematic behavior
- Also called applied behavior analysis

Punishment can be effective if applied correctly:
- Punishment most effective when it occurs immediately after the undesirable behavior
- The CONSISTENCY of punishment is more important than the severity of punishment.

Photo radar - punish is not immediate - police will punish right away photo camera does not.

The cons of punishment
- SEE SLIDES Page 43

Learning and Cognition
- Cognition processes also play a role in behavioral responses
- Tolman and studies on maze completion in rats requiring spatial memory
- Demonstrated existence of cognitive maps ( mental representation of maze )

Observational Learning
- When individuals, after simply watching another person exhibiting behavior that was reinforced or punished, later behaves in the same way or refrains from doing so ( if model punished )
- observe model in the text 

Are viewers effected by what they see on TV - Children in particular
- the answer is yes
There are 3 negative effects 
- Increase in aggressive behavior 
- Overestimation of violence
- Desensitization ( decrease in emotions when viewing violent behavior )

early viewing of violent TV does cause people to be more aggressive.
- positive collation
