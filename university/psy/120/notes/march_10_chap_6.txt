Law of perceptual grouping 
- Law if proximity
    + We group together the nearest most proximal elements
    + See slides
- Law of similarity
    + see slides
- Law of good continuation
- see slides

- Laws of closure
    +  people will fill in missing gaps - to see the full object
- Law of common fate
    + We group together objects that are moving in the same direction

How do we know that something is far away from us.
Binocular Cues (involves both eyes)
- Retinal disparity
    + Discrepancy between corresponding images in the eye
- Convergence  
    + Degree to which eyes turn inwards to focus on an object
- the further away the slower it moves
- the closer it is the faster it moves
Relative motion parallax
    - Relative distance of the object from the viewer determines the amount and direction of motion in the retinal image
Monocular Cues
- Interposition
    + When opaque objects blocks out a second object
- Relative size
    + Objects of the same size at different distances
- Linear perspective
    + The illusion that parallel lines are covered

Perceptual Constancies
Size Constancy
- Perceive the true size of an object despite variations in the size of its retinal image
Shape COnstance
- Perceive an object shape correctly despite the object slanting away from the charing the retinal image
- SLIDES

Ambiguity
- Sometimes single imagines are ambiguous and open to multiple interpretation during perceptual and identification processing

Bottom-up processes
- data-driven processing

Top-down processes
- Conceptual-driven processing

perceptual cliff 
- Experiences
- infants wont get scared until they can crawl

Critical periods
SLIDES

Perception is also influenced by needs
- You want to see something - more easily able to see it.
- but also might imagine that you saw it
by beliefs
by emotions
- Pain, fear etc
by Expectations
- Previous influenced what we perceive (perceptual set)


Western culture focus more on figure than ground
Eastern culture focus more on context

Making people do things by using subliminal persuasion
- flashing eat pop corn and drink coke on the screen at a movie theater

Extrasensory Perception ESP
- Claims that some can send and receive messages about the world without relying on the usual sensory channels (limited empirical support)

Study of purported psycho phenomena such as esp
