chapter 3?

(Learner.org - video about brain stuff)

Brain
	- evenly distribitute activity
	- platicity -perair or adapt from damage
		- adpative - drasticly
	-Left hemisphere is used to language

	- Neurotrasmitter (Slides)
	- Mayjor Neurotrasmitter (Slides)
		- each has different effects and overlaps
			- Serotonine -brainstem
				- Sleep, appetite, sensory perceptiom...(Slides)
				- LSD reduce these effects
				- anti depression drugs increase these effects (not removing the substance)
			- GABA
				- mayjor inhibitory neurotransmitter
				- anxiety - depressive drug
				- critical
			- Acetycholine
				- muscle action, congnitive function, memory and emotion
				- memory lose (alshiemer)
			- Norephinephrine
				- increae heart rate, slowed intestinal activity... 
			- Dopamine
				- volunatory movment, learning, memory, emotion...
				- parkinsion desiese
			- Glutamate
				- Mayor excitatory neurotrasmitter
	-Chemcial Messangers
		- Endorphines
			- do different things when combines than by themself.
			- read in the book or on slides
	- Hormones
		- work alone the nervousystem
		- Mayor hormons (Slides)

Different parts of the brain (Mapping)
	- There are many ways a scientist can study the brain
		-patiens with brain damage
			- lesioning - observing braindamager or removing parts of the brain from animals and observing
				- Mouse and brain removal
					- removing different parts of the brain controled different effects within the same trait like more hunger or less hunger or eating larger portions
				- check slides for mouse and brain removal (no hunger)
		- Electric & Magnetic Dtection (EEG)
			- Recording neural activities by detecting electrons
			- Limited percision
			- New tech uses needels for better detection
			- panfield found what different regions do by using small amout of elec. to stimulate different points of the brain (Map of the brain)
			- Hess - stimulating different parts of the brain at the same time. Mayor functions could be turned on and off by that (see above)
		- Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)
			- magentic field above their head (x40.000 times more than earht)
				- causes neurons under to coil to fire or inactivate others
					- activates an area of the brain (finger movement)
					- nueros fire other neurons
		- Pet Scans
			- analysing Biochemical activities in the brain, using injections of a glucose-like substance containing a radioactive element (shows on screen)
		- MRI
			- MEthod for studing body and brain tissue, using magnetic fields and special radio recivers
		- fMRI is faster (uses oxigen detected) - active parts require me oxygen
		- performance assessed by functional MRI and fMRI

		check slides for pictures if needed

		Brain scans can tell us where something happends but not why and how..

Tour the Brain
	- Localizatin of functions
	- specializations of particular brain areas for particula functions
	- Mayor areas/structure
	(very simple)
	!!!!! SEE SLIDES !!!!!
	and read book. should be important for exam

	- Medola is used fo functions that are automaticaly controled (breating) (green ish)
	- Pons ( above Medola ) involves sleeping, waking, dreaming.
	- RAS - Reticular activating system ( brown stripp ) screens incomming information (without it we could not be alert of even concious)
	same area
	- Cerebellum (back of brain - 36)
		- Regulates movement & balace
		- Lerning simple skills and reflexes
		- cognative task (problems solving, understaning words, etc)
	- Thalamus - above the pons (37)
		- shunting process - relay system
	- Hypothalamus (check slides)
		- maintaining homiostacis, weight
	- Pituitary gland 
		- SLIDES
	- amygddala
		- involving arousal and reluates emotions.
		- instatly checks out threads and danger
		- retiving emotional memeroy
	- Hippocampus
		- Involved in the storage of new information in memory
		- get way to memory
	- Cerebrum
		- Largest brain structure
		- Divided into 2 cerebral hemispheres connected by corpus collosum
		- specialzation (lateralization)
		- We can divide the 2? parts into different lobes
			SEE SLIDES
		4 distinct lobes
		damage to each of these parts can reduce certain traist like vision or smell or taste


- Culture of the Brain
	- Leearning a second language will process the other language somewhere else
	- Same goes for different cultures and different IQ? smart and dumb peoeple lol

- The case of Phinieas Gage
	accident shot a rod though his dead
