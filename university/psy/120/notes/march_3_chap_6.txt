Chpater 6

Sensation
- detection of physical enegery emited by objects
- Mental calculation just by the onbervation of objects. size, how far it is away etc

identtification and recognition
- The procces of assigning meaning to objects
- Involves a higher level of cognative processes to determing what an object os, what it is called, and how we respond....

Proximal stimulus
- The optical image on the retnia

Distal stimulus
- The physical object in the world


INFO look at slides

Transduction
- The conversion of one from of physical enegery into another,
Look at the slides for an image! (seeing things going from object to eyes to nervouse to brain)
Object -> Eyes -> Neural Impulses -> Brain

Vision
Image of the eye

Pupil
- The opening of the eyes which light passes though
Lens
- Make the pupil dilate to control how much light enters
- Reverses and inverts light petters as it focuses images on the retina
Retina
- Back of the eyes and converts light into neural signals
Retinal Integration (Picture)

Dark Adaptation
- Gradually improvement in the eyes sensitivity after a shift in illumination from light to the near darkness
- 7 to 10 minutes cone adaptation
- 10 to 30, rod adaptation
Fovea
- Small region of densely packed cones at the center of the retina ( highest visual acuity )
