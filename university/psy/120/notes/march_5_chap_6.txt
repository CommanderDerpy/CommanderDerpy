Chapter 6

sensation on perception

Fovea - area of sharpess vision

- Neuron impulses leave the retina though the optical nerve
    +  spots where the optocal nerves eist disk or blind receptores and knows as the opical disk or blind spot ???

Visual cortext is the final desitnation for most information

Colores 
- colore is created when lights in decoded in the light source
- all of our exp of light and colore is different
- Visibal range of light is 400-700 nanometers
- wavelenght changed the colore percived
Hue
- descrbes the qualitative qualety of the colore (what colore do you see?)
Saturated
- Captures the purity and vividness of colore
Birghtness
- Refers to the intensity of light

The combination of all wavelgnths of colores gets you white
complementary colore

Colore blind

Dichromatism
- !!!! SOMETHING !!!
Monochoromatsim
- Can not see any colore


HEaring
sounds at 1100 feet per second

Frequency
- numbers of cycles the waves complete
MORE
Human hearing 30-20,000 Hz

Pitch 
- is the lowness of the sound

Loudness 
- AMplitude of the sound wave (dB)
- psychological everybody expertnesses sound differently.

Timber
- Complexity of the sound wave
- pure to only have 1 freq and 1 amplitude

Most sound are not pure
Most sounds sound different on most devices (Piano, laptop, etc)

Noise
- contain many freq which are not related to another.
- no fundamental freq no sound that we can hear.

air born sound wave have to be translated into fluid waves in the cochlea of the ear.
Pinna provides protection and channels sound

The Ear canal makes sounds more ?

ear drum vibrates depending on the freq of the sound

The role of the middle ear in sound is amplification
    - hammer, anvil etc
        + increase sound by a factor of 30
the inner ear 
    - Oval window vibrates
    - the Cochlea is the sound preceptor
    - Cochlea is filled with fluid
    - movement of the hair inside the Cochlea that converts the sound movement to electrical signal which gets send to the brain for ??

Damaging the hair inside the Cochlea will not grow back.. ever.

Relative timing. 
our brains calculate the difference it takes for sound to travel to one ear and then the other.
most effective for low freq

Relative intensity 
Head cats a sound shadow producing intensity difference between the ears. so we know which side it is coming from.


Smell
- oder first interact with receptors membrane in our noses
- at least 40 nervous ending must have fired before we can smell something
- involved in sensing food and detecting of danger.

Taste
Many tastes are actually smells
Both sense work together. esp when we eat
Papillae
- 
Taste buds
- 10.000 taste buds on the tongue
- Children have more taste buds
    + bigger reaction
5 basic taste
- salty
- sour
- bitter
- sweet
- umami

different people taste different based on
- Genetics
- Culture
- Learning
- Food attraction

Cutaneous senses (skin)

Other senses
Vestibular Senses -
Kinesthetic Senses -

Pain mechanism
- Network of pain receptors cover the body like a fine mesh
- Some only respond to temperature while others respond to chemical or mechanical stimuli
- indophines in our brain effect the way we feel pain


Perceptual Processing.
Attention -
Perceptual Grouping
    + Gestalt theory
