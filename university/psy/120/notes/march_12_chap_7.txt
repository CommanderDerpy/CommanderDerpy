Unconditional Stimulus
- Any stimulus that naturally elicits a behavior
- Dogs starting to drool when they see food.

Neutral Stimulus
- Has no connection to anything
- with associated with an Unconditional Stimulus can become a conditioned stimulus.

Conditioned Stimulus 
- A neutral Stimulus that is able to elicits

SEE SLIDES FOR EXPLANATION


Acquisition 
- The process of making the connection.
- Timing is the key - they have to be close enough to make a connection
    Trace conditioning
    - CS is turned off before UCS is presented
    Delay
    - 
    Simultaneous
    - 
    Backwards
    -

Extinction
- The weakening with the CR as a result of absence of CS and UCS
Spontaneous recovery
- The sudden reappearance of the CR after the rest period without further exposure to the UCS
- saving

2 other related issues
Stimulus Generalization
- Automatic extension of conditioned responses to stimuli that are similar to the CS
- The more similar the CS (original ) the stronger the responses
Stimulus Discrimination
- Learning to respond differently to stimuli that differ from the CS on some dimension

Emotional Response and fear conditions
- Horror movie
-  Little Albert (link)
Preference
- Food likes / dislike, advertising
Drug use and addiction
- Siegel's research indication the setting for drug use becomes conditions with bodily responses

Operant Condition
(one step away - also about learning)

Thorndike observed cats trying to escape a puzzle box.
out side was food
they would just run around the box until they hit a leaver and the door opened
they learned it by escaping once.

Law of effort
- A response followers by satisfying consequences become more probable than a response followed bu dissatisfying consequences


Rats performing behavior followed b positive and negative consequences.

Reinforcement Contingency
- if you get something after achieving something ( contingent )

Reinforcer
- increases the prob. of a respond
- increases an behavior

Positive Reinforcer
-

Negative Reinforcer
- Behavior that makes followed by the removal of an aversive stimuli (increases behavior)
- Escape conditioning - responses allows escape from aversive stimuli
    + for example car noise ( light on)
- Avoidance conditioning - response allows avoidance of aversive stimuli before it begins

Punisher 
- Stimuli that, when made contingent on a response, decreases the probability of that response.
- decrease an behavior
Positive punisher
-  not working well
negative punisher
- something is taken away to remove some behavior

Primary reinforcer
- Handful of these exist at birth - reinforcing properties were biologically determining (food, water)

Conditional (secondary) Reinforcer
-

Primary Punisher

Conditional (secondary) Punisher

Look at the graph sound in the sidles (page 30)

Discriminative Stimuli
- Stimuli that precede at particular responses (reinforcement or punishment) and come to set the context that behavior
- Referred  to as the three-term contingency (discriminative)
